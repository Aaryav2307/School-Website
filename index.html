                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Kothari International School hosted a Yoga session for the
                    staff members. The resource person focused on the
                    flexibility of body and mental peace. Mr. Sandeep
                    professed that yoga is accepted worldwide as one of the
                    most effective form of exercise to influence the mental
                    control. A qualified yoga trainer imparted basic yoga
                    knowledge to the staff members.
                    The staff members practiced various yoga asanas under
                    the guidance of the trainer, starting with warming up and
                    stretching followed by the series of asanas. A yoga
                    capsule was also designed for the students of the school
                    which has to be done every day. The capsule consisted of
                    some asanas and mantras which will help the students and
                    teachers to attain mental peace and healthy growth
                    All the staff members really enjoyed the session and
                    could feel a difference in their bodies.

                Staying committed to the UN sustainability goals of environmental well-being, we at Kothari
                International School, Noida, are dedicated towards taking our school, children and faculty towards
                environmental excellence, in the years to come.

                What exactly does it mean to GO GREEN? – The KIS fraternity is a strong believer in taking steps towards
                protecting the environment and doing our part towards securing the future for the generations in our
                charge. ‘Going Green,’ to us, simply means taking the necessary steps to go beyond academia by teaching
                and empowering our children towards a healthier, cleaner and more sustainable living. We do this with
                regular engagement in action-oriented and socially liable learning projects.

                It is our endeavour that our ‘Kothari’s Green Regime’ would significantly contribute towards lowering
                greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint, energy costs etc. and, that all of our goals would be
                achieved with 100% student involvement.

                Keeping in line with the goals we have set for our school, the projects initiated within our School
                Campus are detailed as under:



                ENERGY EFFICIENCY:

                Every ounce of oil, every lump of coal and every cubic foot of natural gas could be left in the ground
                if only we could capture one hours’ worth of solar energy each year. With this scale of opportunity our
                school has committed itself towards choosing a renewable energy source i.e. solar panels, thereby
                reducing the amount of fossil fuels consumed and minimizing our carbon footprint. We have found that
                solar energy is a cleaner and safer alternative to commercialized fuels such as gas etc. Five dedicated
                solar panels help us achieve our energy goal and our objective is to increase that number and ‘stay
                solar superior’ in the years to come.



                Lights in the school have transitioned over the years from regular commercial lighting to CFL’s and now
                to low consumption LED’s.



                AIR QUALITY:

                Kothari International School is a firm believer of going green through ‘Planting Trees and Planting
                Hope.’ Our school has committed itself to an annual tree plantation drive and has been successful in
                implementation over the last two years. The year 2019 saw a slight difference in the drive with specific
                focus being given to the plantation of trees with medicinal value. The project involved approximately
                160 students with a multidisciplinary approach to learning.









                WATER QUALITY:

                Kothari International School controls and reduces water surplus, consumes fresh water as efficiently as
                possible and recovers and reuses water to the extent feasible as basic efficiency measures can help
                increase a school’s efficiency. These reductions help the environment, locally and regionally and lower
                a school’s operating expenses. Our state of the art landscaping, water treatment, and recycling
                strategies are used to help instruct students on ecology and the environment thereby working in tandem
                to achieve our goals.





                Our School’s efficient RO system has ensured that we work towards meeting the goals set on energy
                efficiency and water sustainability. Water is recycled throughout the day and reused to meet the water
                consumption of the school. All water used in the restrooms are transitioned from the RO sources at the
                end of the day and are thereby effectively reutilized.



                Due to the severe water scarcity in many regions we have found that the only way to combat water
                scarcity is by creating systems for artificial recharge of groundwater. Collected rainwater is stored
                and utilized in different ways thereby ensuring that rain water harvesting is the prime responsibility
                of the school.



                A Green school like ours, includes overwhelming health and educational benefits. We hope to continue
                exploring real-world problems and becoming a community of environmentally-minded thinkers.
